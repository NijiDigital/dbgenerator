alias:
  #   The template named 'android-java' was originally just named `android`
  #   and was written in Java before Kotlin even existed.
  #
  #   So this alias exists mainly for compatibility reasons, so that people
  #   who used `-t android` in previous versions of `gyro` can still continue
  #   to do so and that this new update of gyro doesn't break their setup.
  android: android-java
  #   The template named 'anviking-decodable' was originally just named 'decodable'
  #   as it was made to generate JSON parsing code using the Anviking/Decodable pod.
  #
  #   But now that Swift 4 has protocol Decodable, this template name is confusing,
  #   so we decided to rename it anviking-decodable and deprecate the old name,
  #   so that when we have time to create a template for Swift 4's Codable there
  #   won't be any risk of confusion.
  decodable: anviking-decodable
  #   It happens that the `swift3` template is also compatible with Swift 4 without any change.
  #   So we can use the same template for both Swift 3 and Swift 4
  swift4: swift3
deprecated:
  - object-mapper
  - swift3-variant
  - android   # renamed android-java
  - decodable # renamed anviking-decodable
